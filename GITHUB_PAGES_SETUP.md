# üöÄ Complete Beginner's Guide to Publishing Your Habit Tracker

This guide assumes you've never used GitHub before and will walk you through everything step-by-step.

## ü§î What We're Going to Do

We're going to:
1. Put your app code on GitHub (a website where programmers store their code)
2. Set up automatic publishing so your app becomes a live website
3. Configure it so your friends can use it from anywhere in the world

## üìã What You Need Before Starting

- ‚úÖ A computer with internet connection
- ‚úÖ A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- ‚úÖ The habit tracker code (which you already have)
- ‚úÖ Your Supabase credentials (which you already provided)

## üéØ Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is like Google Drive, but for code. It stores your app and can automatically turn it into a live website.

### How to Sign Up:
1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)**
2. **Click the green "Sign up" button** (top-right corner)
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - Choose a username (this will be part of your website URL)
   - Enter your email address
   - Create a strong password
4. **Verify your email** by checking your inbox and clicking the confirmation link
5. **Complete any additional setup steps** GitHub asks for

üí° **Your website will eventually be at:** `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/habit-tracker/`

## üéØ Step 2: Install Git on Your Computer

### What is Git?
Git is a tool that helps you upload your code to GitHub. Think of it like the upload button for code.

### For Windows:
1. **Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)**
2. **Download Git for Windows**
3. **Run the installer** and click "Next" through all the options (the defaults are fine)
4. **IMPORTANT: Restart your computer** after installation
5. **After restart, use Command Prompt (not PowerShell):**
   - Press Windows + R
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter
   - This opens Command Prompt (black window with white text)
6. **Test if Git is installed by typing:** `git --version`
   - If it shows a version number, Git is installed correctly
   - If you still get an error, see troubleshooting below

### For Mac:
1. **Open Terminal** (press Cmd+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)
2. **Type this command and press Enter:**
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
3. **If Git isn't installed**, your Mac will automatically ask to install it
4. **Follow the prompts** to install

### For Linux:
1. **Open Terminal**
2. **Type this command:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

## üéØ Step 3: Create a New Repository on GitHub

### What is a Repository?
A repository (or "repo") is like a folder on GitHub that contains all your app's files.

### Steps:
1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in**
2. **Click the green "New" button** or look for a "+" icon in the top-right
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - **Repository name:** Type `habit-tracker` (exactly like this)
   - **Description:** Type "A habit tracking app for me and my friends"
   - **Make sure it's set to "Public"** (this is required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DON'T check any of the initialize boxes** (we already have code)
4. **Click the green "Create repository" button**

üéâ **You now have an empty repository!** GitHub will show you a page with instructions, but don't worry about those - we'll do it differently.

## üéØ Step 4: Upload Your Code to GitHub

### Open Your Computer's Terminal/Command Prompt

**For Windows:**
- Press Windows key + R
- Type `cmd` and press Enter
- OR search for "Command Prompt" in the start menu

**For Mac:**
- Press Cmd + Space
- Type "Terminal" and press Enter

**For Linux:**
- Press Ctrl + Alt + T

### Navigate to Your Project Folder

1. **Find where your habit tracker code is stored** on your computer
2. **In the terminal, type `cd ` (with a space after cd)**
3. **Drag your project folder into the terminal window** - this will automatically type the path
4. **Press Enter**

üí° **Example:** If your code is in Documents/habit-tracker, you'd type exactly this (without the word "bash"):

**Type this:**
```
cd Documents/habit-tracker
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Don't copy the word "bash" or the backticks (```). Only copy the text inside!

### Upload Your Code

Now copy and paste these commands **one at a time** (without "bash"), pressing Enter after each:

**Command 1:**
```
git init
```
Copy exactly: `git init` (without the backticks)
Press Enter, wait for it to finish, then do the next command.

**Command 2:**
```
git add .
```
Copy exactly: `git add .` (don't forget the dot!)
Press Enter, wait for it to finish.

**Command 3:**
```
git commit -m "Initial commit: My habit tracker app"
```
Copy exactly: `git commit -m "Initial commit: My habit tracker app"` (include the quotes!)
Press Enter, wait for it to finish.

**Command 4:**
```
git branch -M main
```
Copy exactly: `git branch -M main`
Press Enter, wait for it to finish.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in the next command with your actual GitHub username:

**Command 5 (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username):**
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habit-tracker.git
```
Example: If your username is "john123", you'd type:
`git remote add origin https://github.com/john123/habit-tracker.git`

**Command 6:**
```
git push -u origin main
```
Copy exactly: `git push -u origin main`
This will upload your code to GitHub.

### What if you get an error?
- **If it asks for your username/password:** Enter your GitHub username and password
- **If it says "permission denied":** You might need to set up authentication (see troubleshooting section below)

## üéØ Step 5: Set Up Your Secret Keys

### What are Secret Keys?
Your app needs to connect to Supabase (your database). The connection requires secret keys that should be kept private.

### Steps:
1. **Go to your repository on GitHub** (github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habit-tracker)
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (it's in the row with Code, Issues, Pull requests, etc.)
3. **In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables"**
4. **Click "Actions"**
5. **Click the green "New repository secret" button**

### Add Your First Secret:
1. **Name:** Type exactly: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
2. **Secret:** Copy and paste exactly: `https://bbnzarpwyblxhujlbfgz.supabase.co`
3. **Click "Add secret"**

### Add Your Second Secret:
1. **Click "New repository secret" again**
2. **Name:** Type exactly: `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. **Secret:** Copy and paste exactly: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJibnphcnB3eWJseGh1amxiZmd6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTM3MDMzNTgsImV4cCI6MjA2OTI3OTM1OH0.Rj3K0sEZH43t_nv9goizdnpLim8gtA2KSQt46wtfAF0`
4. **Click "Add secret"**

üí° **You should now see 2 secrets listed** (the values will be hidden for security)

## üéØ Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages

### What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a free service that turns your code into a live website that anyone can visit.

### Steps:
1. **Still in your repository settings**, scroll down to find **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Pages"**
3. **Under "Source"**, click the dropdown and select **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. **Under "Branch"**, click the dropdown and select **"gh-pages"**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you don't see "gh-pages"**, that's okay - it will appear after the first deployment
   - For now, just leave it as "None" and come back to this step later
5. **Click "Save"**

## üéØ Step 7: Trigger Your First Deployment

### What's a Deployment?
Deployment is the process of taking your code and turning it into a live website.

### Steps:
1. **Go to the "Actions" tab** in your repository (next to Settings)
2. **You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow**
3. **If it's not running automatically**, click "Run workflow"
4. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for it to complete
   - Green checkmark = Success ‚úÖ
   - Red X = Something went wrong ‚ùå

### If it fails:
1. **Click on the failed workflow**
2. **Look for error messages** (usually in red text)
3. **Check the troubleshooting section below**

## üéØ Step 8: Complete GitHub Pages Setup

### After successful deployment:
1. **Go back to Settings ‚Üí Pages**
2. **Under "Branch"**, select **"gh-pages"** (it should now be available)
3. **Leave "/ (root)" selected**
4. **Click "Save"**

## üéâ Step 9: Access Your Live Website!

### Your website will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/habit-tracker/`

### Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username

**Example:** If your GitHub username is "john123", your website would be:
`https://john123.github.io/habit-tracker/`

### What to expect:
- ‚úÖ You should see the login screen
- ‚úÖ You can create accounts
- ‚úÖ You can add habits and track them
- ‚úÖ Everything should work just like when you tested it locally

## üéØ Step 10: Share with Your Friends

### Share this URL with your friends:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/habit-tracker/`

### They can:
1. **Create their own accounts**
2. **Set up their personal habits**
3. **Track their daily progress**
4. **See everyone's summary on the Summary tab**

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "git is not recognized" (Windows)
**This means Git is not installed or not working properly**

**Solution 1 - Install Git:**
1. **Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)**
2. **Run the installer (Git-2.xx.x-64-bit.exe)**
3. **Click "Next" through all the setup screens** (defaults are fine)
4. **MUST restart your computer** after installation
5. **Use Command Prompt (cmd), not PowerShell**

**Solution 2 - Check if Git was installed correctly:**
1. **Press Windows + R, type `cmd`, press Enter**
2. **Type exactly:** `git --version`
3. **If you see a version number like "git version 2.xx.x"** ‚Üí Git is installed
4. **If you still get "not recognized"** ‚Üí Git didn't install correctly, try Solution 1 again

**Solution 3 - Use the right terminal:**
- ‚ùå **Don't use:** PowerShell (blue window)
- ‚úÖ **Use:** Command Prompt (black window)
- **How to open Command Prompt:** Windows + R ‚Üí type `cmd` ‚Üí Enter

### Issue: "The term 'ash' is not recognized" (Windows)
**Problem:** You copied the markdown formatting (```bash) instead of just the command
**Solution:**
1. **Never copy the word "bash" or the backticks (```)**
2. **Only copy the actual command text**
3. **Use Command Prompt (cmd) instead of PowerShell**
   - Press Windows key + R
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter
   - This opens the correct terminal for Windows


### Issue: "Permission denied" when pushing to GitHub
**Solutions:**
1. **Try using personal access token instead of password:**
   - Go to GitHub.com ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with "repo" permissions
   - Use this token instead of your password

2. **Or set up SSH (more advanced):**
   - Follow GitHub's SSH guide: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

### Issue: Deployment fails with build errors
**Solution:**
1. Check that both secrets are set correctly
2. Make sure secret names are exactly: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Verify the secret values match exactly what you provided

### Issue: Website shows "404 Not Found"
**Solutions:**
1. Wait 10 minutes and try again (GitHub Pages can be slow)
2. Make sure GitHub Pages is set to deploy from "gh-pages" branch
3. Check that the deployment workflow completed successfully

### Issue: Website loads but shows "Failed to fetch"
**Solutions:**
1. Double-check your GitHub Secrets are set correctly
2. Try clearing your browser cache
3. Check browser console for specific error messages

### Issue: Can't find "gh-pages" branch in Pages settings
**Solution:**
1. Make sure the deployment workflow ran successfully first
2. The gh-pages branch is created automatically by the workflow
3. If workflow fails, the branch won't be created

## üîÑ Making Updates Later

### When you want to update your app:
1. **Make changes to your code**
2. **In terminal, navigate to your project folder**
3. **Run these commands:**
   
   **Command 1:**
   ```
   git add .
   ```
   
   **Command 2:**
   ```
   git commit -m "Description of what you changed"
   ```
   
   **Command 3:**
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **GitHub will automatically update your website** in 2-5 minutes

## üí° Understanding What Happens

### The automatic process:
1. **You push code** to the "main" branch
2. **GitHub Actions runs** your deployment workflow
3. **It builds your app** with the secret keys
4. **Creates a "gh-pages" branch** with the built website
5. **GitHub Pages serves** the website from that branch
6. **Your friends can access** the live website

## üÜò Getting Help

### If you're still stuck:
1. **Check the Actions tab** for specific error messages
2. **Google the exact error message** you're seeing
3. **Ask on GitHub Community forums**
4. **Double-check each step** in this guide

### Common mistakes:
- ‚ùå Typing secret names incorrectly
